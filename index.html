            Don’t read another “bad” book again.

            Since many Amazon products suffer from bias in their ratings, we help readers avoid wasting time and regret bad book purchases by evaluating Amazon books on 3 criteria:

            1. how recently did the book come out?
            2. what's the success rate of people who bought the book?
            3. what percentage of people have rated the book 1-star?

            We then judge these scores on a pass/fail basis and show these scores only on Amazon book's product pages so you are instantly informed.
